The club was founded in 1903. The club's home ground is the Arena do Grêmio, to which it moved in 2013, having previously played at Estádio Olímpico Monumental since 1954.

Grêmio was the first club outside the Southeast of Brazil to become World Champion, after beating Hamburger SV in 1983 (2-1) [2][3][4]. Also, Grêmio is the Brazilian club that most won the Copa Libertadores da América (3), alongside São Paulo (3) and Santos (3)[5].
